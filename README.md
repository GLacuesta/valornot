# ValorNot

Inspiration: Valorant (the FPS game)

## What's this all about

Basically, the web app lets you view a set of agents (characters) and you get to match them randomly within the app.
They fight automatically and gives you the result... Win / Loose

The agents are selected through a card like structure and that becomes your roster for the match.

## Ideas on what to implement

Card like design - character images will be made from a non copyright source
Card selection and animation - thinking of motion framer here
Fight animation - same framer motion but this time around it involves fight randomize as there will maps and plays per game; e.g. Rush A or play for picks in B site.

# Your normal setup README here -_-

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
